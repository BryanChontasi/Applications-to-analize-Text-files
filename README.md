# Applications-to-analize-Text-files
NetBeans
by Bryan Chontasi

# Application1-
Inspects the Text file Called sonnet1-a.txt (This file contains one of Shakespeare’s famous sonnets)
the application counts:
  -the total number of words
  -the total number of letters
  -the total number of words with an even number of letters
  -the total number of words with an odd number of letters.

The program also stores the sets of odd words and even words, where each word is translated into an upper-case equivalent
However, for these two sets of words, each unique word is stored once. For example, even if the word ‘And’ occurs several times, it is stored once in the set of odd words.
The program prints the results in alphabetical order

In addition to the console output, the program also saves all of the output
to a text file called results.txt.
